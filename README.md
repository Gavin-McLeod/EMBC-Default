Holding and sharing repo for proofing tabs for the cvse "what's new" feature.

    	<p>Attempt to find a Bootstrap driven solution to the problems associated with the current "What's New" page of the CVSE site.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Primary content navigation should still be tabs</li>
    		<li>Secondary navigation can be anything reasonable but drop-down navigation is suggested</li>
    		<li>The solution should realise 3 primary goals
    			<ul>
    				<li>clean up the navigation visually -- drop-downs may help, but may also remove user intuition by hiding navigation options</li>
    				<li>material should be reachable through a URL</li>
    				<li>tables should allow the user to sort their data by column</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
    	</ul>
    	<h3>Current features of this sampler</h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Bootstrap based</li>
    		<li>Tabbed primary navigation -- see the Bootstrap Tabs <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs"> documentation</a></li>
    		<li>menued secondary navigation</li>
    		<li>all content accessible through the URL using a querystring</li>
    		<li>sortable tables - at least one acceptable solution, but there may be others.  See <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/drvic10k/bootstrap-sortable">https://github.com/drvic10k/bootstrap-sortable</a></li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>Also:  This page uses the CSS file from the CMS, almost as documented.</p>
